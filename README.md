# AB-Testing-Project
The objective of this case study is to illustrate the process of conducting A/B testing. An artificial dataset from Kaggle has been utilized for this purpose.

This project is a comprehensive case study that not only utilizes an artificial dataset sourced from Kaggle but also includes clear descriptions of each step involved in conducting A/B testing. 
It provides a practical and hands-on exploration of this statistical analysis technique, enabling you to gain a thorough understanding of the entire process. 
A/B testing is a powerful method used in data analysis and experimentation to compare two or more variations of a particular element, such as a webpage design, marketing campaign, or user interface. 
By randomly assigning participants to different variants and measuring their responses, A/B testing facilitates data-driven decision-making and optimization of strategies. 
Through this project, you will not only work with the Kaggle dataset but also learn how to formulate hypotheses, collect and analyze data, interpret the results, and draw meaningful conclusions. 
It serves as an educational resource for anyone interested in understanding and implementing A/B testing methodologies, providing both the dataset and a clear guide to conducting A/B tests throughout the process.
